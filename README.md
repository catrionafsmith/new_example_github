# Burns Night Site
---
This is a website that was made to practice using JavaScript, and to celebrate Burns Night (25th January).
It displays a poem by the famed Scottish poet Robert Burns, and includes some interactive buttons.

This website was made to practice connecting CSS and JavaScript files with HTML, and to practice creating buttons and linking them to JavaScript functions.

__Built with:__ HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

__What I have learned:__ I was able to practice targeting buttons and adding event listeners to them. I also reviewed how to add sound to a website.

__Issues I faced and how I resolved them:__ I wanted to add a favicon, but I couldn't figure out how to ensure that it was linked to my site. I ran out of time so decided not to continue pursuing this (as I may have just needed to restart my browser). 

__What I would do differently next time:__ There is a button to start the audio of the poem. I wanted to add a button to stop the audio from playing, but couldn't get the function audio.stop() to work. To solve the problem I just used the function location.reload() which stopped the audio as it refreshed the page.

__Source:__ The poem is by Robert Burns. The README.md template is by skirianov.
